# DShell
A library and tooling for building console/cli applications and scripts using the Dart programming language.


If you are looking for DShell then you are almost at the right place.

As of August 2020 we have renamed DShell to DCli to better reflect what DCli actually does.

Nothing else is changed, nothing to see here.

You can find the renamed project at [DCli](https://github.com/bsutton/dcli/blob/master/README.md)
